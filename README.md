# rock-paper-scissors card game

## Introduction
It's a card game about rock-paper-scissors. Every player have 15 cards involving three kinds.
5 rock, 5 paper, and 5 scissors.
Every turn, each player should show a card and compare them.
That's a normal rule.
The winner of this turn will win the card loser showed and card he showed.
When a player loses all cards, he loses this game.

Child and student will play this game to train their brain or just for relax.
That's a game I designed in my middle school,
just making an interesting improvement of original one. 
I draw them on paper and played with my classmates.
Now I have a chance to display it through Java,
that's amazing.
